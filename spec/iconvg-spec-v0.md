# IconVG Specification

[REF: Commit 498f1a0 on Jun 1, 2021](https://github.com/google/iconvg/blob/498f1a067f290778e3e0bd46f494c8044f9de21f/spec/iconvg-spec.md)

IconVG is a compact, binary format for simple vector graphics: icons, logos,
glyphs and emoji.

**WARNING: THIS FORMAT IS EXPERIMENTAL AND SUBJECT TO INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES.**


## Structure

An IconVG graphic consists of a magic identifier, one or more metadata bytes
then a sequence of variable length instructions for a register-based virtual
machine.

Those instructions encode a sequence of filled paths, similar to [SVG path
data](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData). Rendering involves
switching between two modes: a *styling mode* where color and other registers
are set and a *drawing mode* where a path's geometry is defined. The virtual
machine starts in the styling mode.

In both modes, rendering proceeds by reading a one byte opcode followed by a
variable number of data bytes for that opcode. The mapping from byte values to
opcodes depends on whether the renderer is in the styling or drawing mode. A
`0x07` byte value means setting the color selector register in the styling
mode and means adding multiple lineto segments in the drawing mode.


## Registers

The machine state includes 64 *color registers* (denoted `CREG[0], CREG[1],
..., CREG[63]`) and 64 *number registers* (denoted `NREG[0], NREG[1], ...,
NREG[63]`). Register indexing is done modulo 64, so `CREG[70]` is the same as
`CREG[6]`, and `CREG[-1]` is the same as `CREG[63]`.

Each `CREG` and `NREG` register is 32 bits wide. The `CREG` registers are
initialized to the custom palette ([see below](#palettes)); the `NREG`
registers are initialized to `0`. The machine state also includes two *selector
registers* (denoted `CSEL` and `NSEL`). They are effectively 6 bit integers, as
they index `CREG` and `NREG`, and are also initialized to `0`.

Color registers are four `uint8` values (red, green, blue and alpha), denoted
by colon-separated 2-hexadecimal-digit numbers in `RR:GG:BB:AA` order.

Number registers are `float32` values.


### Level of Detail

The machine state includes 2 *level of detail registers* (denoted `LOD0` and
`LOD1`, both `float32` values) initialized to `+0` and `+infinity`. Drawing
mode opcodes have no effect (other than leaving drawing mode) unless the height
`H` in pixels of the rasterization satisfies `(LOD0 <= H)` and `(H < LOD1)`.

This allows the format to provide a simpler version for small rasterizations
(e.g. below 32 pixels) and a more complex version for large rasterizations
(e.g. 32 and above pixels).


## Colors and Gradients

IconVG graphics work in 32 bit alpha-premultiplied color, with 8 bits for red,
green, blue and alpha. Alpha-premultiplication means that `00:C0:00:C0`
represents a 75%-opaque, 100% Saturation, 100% Value green (with 120° Hue).

Interpolation between explicit gradient stops also uses alpha-premultiplied
color, unlike SVG. The halfway color between opaque bright red = `RGBA(1, 0, 0,
1)` and transparent black = `RGBA(0, 0, 0, 0)`, which is `RGBA(½, 0, 0, ½)`, is
a 50% opaque bright red, not a 50% opaque dark red. The halfway point still has
100% Saturation and 100% Value (in the HSV Hue Saturation Value sense). It just
has smaller alpha.

Alpha-premultiplication also means that some `RGBA` combinations (where e.g.
the red value is greater than the alpha value) are nonsensical. The virtual
machine re-purposes some of those values to represent *gradients* instead of
flat colors. Any color register whose alpha value is `0` but whose blue value
is at least `128` is a gradient. Its remaining bits are reinterpreted such
that:

- The low 6 bits of the red value is the number of color/offset stops,
  `NSTOPS`.
- The high 2 bits of the red value are reserved.
- The low 6 bits of the green value is the color register base, `CBASE`.
- The high 2 bits of the green value is how to spread the gradient past its
  nominal bounds (from offset being `0.0` to offset being `1.0`). The high two
  bits being `0`, `1`, `2` or `3` mean none, pad, reflect and repeat
  respectively.
  - *None* means that offsets outside of the `[0.0, 1.0]` range map to
    transparent black.
  - *Pad* means that offsets below `0.0` and above `1.0` map to the colors that
    `0.0` and `1.0` would map to.
  - *Reflect* means that the offset mapping is reflected start-to-end,
    end-to-start, start-to-end, etc.
  - *Repeat* means that the offset mapping is repeated start-to-end,
    start-to-end, start-to-end, etc.
- The low 6 bits of the blue value is the number register base, `NBASE`.
- The remaining bit (the `0x40` bit) of the blue value denotes the gradient
  shape: `0` means a *linear gradient* and `1` means a *radial gradient*.

The gradient has `NSTOPS` color/offset stops. The first stop has color
`CREG[CBASE+0]` and offset `NREG[NBASE+0]`, the second stop has color
`CREG[CBASE+1]` and offset `NREG[NBASE+1]`, and so on.

The gradient also uses the six numbers from `NREG[NBASE-6]` to `NREG[NBASE-1]`,
which form an *affine transformation matrix* `[a, b, c; d, e, f]` such that
`a=NREG[NBASE-6], b=NREG[NBASE-5], ..., f=NREG[NBASE-1]`. This matrix maps from
graphic coordinate space (defined by the metadata's viewBox) to gradient
coordinate space. Gradient coordinate space is where a linear gradient ranges
from `x=0` to `x=1`, and a radial gradient has center `(0, 0)` and radius `1`.

The graphic coordinate `(px, py)` maps to the gradient coordinate `(dx, dy)`
by:

    dx = (a * px) + (b * py) + c
    dy = (d * px) + (e * py) + f

The [appendix below](#appendix---gradient-transformation-matrices) gives
explicit formulae for the `[a, b, c; d, e, f]` affine transformation matrix for
common gradient geometry, such as a linear gradient defined by two points.

At the time a gradient is used to fill a path, it is invalid for any of the
stop colors to itself be a gradient, or for any stop offset to be less than or
equal to a previous offset, or outside the range `[0, 1]`.


### Colors

Color register values are always 32 bits, or 4 bytes. Colors in the instruction
byte stream can be encoded more compactly, and are encoded in either 1, 2, 3 or
4 bytes, depending on context. For example, some opcodes are followed by a 1
byte color, others by a 2 byte color. There are two forms of 3 byte colors:
direct and indirect.

For a *1 byte encoding*, byte values in the range `[0, 125)` encode the `RGBA`
color where the red, green and blue values come from the base-5 encoding of
that byte value such that `0`, `1`, `2`, `3` and `4` map to `0x00`, `0x40`,
`0x80`, `0xC0` and `0xFF`. The alpha value is `0xFF`. For example, the color
`40:FF:C0:FF` can be encoded as `0x30`, as decimal `48` equals `(1*25 + 4*5 +
3)`. A byte value of `125`, `126` or `127` mean the colors `C0:C0:C0:C0`,
`80:80:80:80` and `00:00:00:00` respectively. Byte values in the range `[128,
192)` mean a color from the custom palette (indexed by that byte value minus
`128`). Byte values in the range `[192, 256)` mean the value of a `CREG` color
register (with `CREG` indexed by that byte value minus `192`).

For a *2 byte encoding*, the red, green, blue and alpha values are all 4 bit
values which are extended to 8 bits by duplicating each nibble (or
equivalently, they are 4 bit color values interpolated to an 8 bit color
space). For example, the color `33:88:00:FF` can be encoded as `0x38 0x0F`.

For a *3 byte direct encoding*, the red, green and blue values are all 8 bit
values. The alpha value is implicitly 255. For example, the color `30:66:07:FF`
can be encoded as `0x30 0x66 0x07`.

For a *4 byte encoding*, the red, green, blue and alpha values are all 8 bit
values. For example, the color `30:66:07:80` is simply `0x30 0x66 0x07 0x80`.

For a *3 byte indirect encoding*, the first byte is an integer value in the
range `[0, 255]` (denoted `T`) and the second and third bytes are each a 1 byte
encoded color (denoted `C0` and `C1`). The resultant color's red channel value
is given by:

    RESULTANT.RED = (((255-T) * C0.RED) + (T * C1.RED) + 128) / 255

rounded down to an integer value (the mathematical floor function), and
likewise for the green, blue and alpha channels. For example, if the custom
palette's third entry is a fully opaque orange, then `0x40 0x7F 0x82` encodes a
25% percent opaque orange: a blend of 75% times fully transparent (1 byte color
`0x7F`) and 25% times a fully opaque orange (1 byte color `0x82`).

It is valid for some encodings to yield a color value where the red, green or
blue value is greater than the alpha value, as this may be a gradient. If it
isn't a gradient, the subsequent rendering is undefined.


### Palettes

Rendering an IconVG graphic can be varied by a 64 color palette. For example,
an emoji graphic may be rendered with palette color 0 for skin and palette
color 1 for hair. Decorative variations, such as different clothing, can be
implemented by palette colors possibly set to completely transparent to switch
paths off.

Rendering software should allow users to pass an optional 64 color palette. If
one isn't provided, the suggested palette (either [given in the
metadata](#mid-1-suggested-palette) or the default consisting entirely of
opaque black) should be used. Whichever palette ends up being used is
designated the *custom palette*.

Some user-given colors may be nonsensical as alpha-premultiplied colors, where
e.g. the red value is greater than the alpha value. Such colors are replaced by
opaque black and not re-interpreted as gradients.

Assigning names such as "skin", "hair" or "bow-tie" to the integer indexes of
that 64 color palette is out of scope of the IconVG format per se.


## Numbers

Like colors, numbers are encoded in the instruction stream in either 1, 2 or 4
bytes. Unlike colors, the encoding length is not determined by context (the
opcode). Instead, the low two bits of the first byte indicate the encoding
length.

If the least significant bit (the `0x01` bit) of the first byte is `0`, the
number is encoded in 1 byte. Otherwise, it is encoded in 2 or 4 bytes depending
on the second least significant bit (the `0x02` bit) of the first byte being
`0` or `1`.


### Natural Numbers

For a *1 byte encoding*, the remaining 7 bits form an integer value in the
range `[0, 1<<7)`. For example, `0x28` encodes the value `0x14` or, in decimal,
`20`.

For a *2 byte encoding*, the remaining 14 bits, interpreted as little endian,
form an integer in the range `[0, 1<<14)`. For example, `0x59 0x83` encodes the
value `0x20D6` or, in decimal, `8406`.

For a *4 byte encoding*, the remaining 30 bits, interpreted as little endian,
form an integer in the range `[0, 1<<30)`. For example, `0x07 0x00 0x80 0x3F`
encodes the value `0xFE0_0001` or, in decimal, `266_338305`.


### Real Numbers

The encoding of a real number resembles the encoding of a natural number. For
*1 and 2 byte encodings*, the decoded real number equals the decoded natural
number. For example, `0x28` encodes the real number `20.0`, just as it encodes
the natural number `20`.

For a *4 byte encoding*, the decoded natural number, in the range `[0, 1<<30)`,
is shifted left by 2, to make a `uint32` value that is a multiple of 4. The
decoded real number is the single-precision floating point number corresponding
to the IEEE 754 binary representation of that `uint32` (i.e. a reinterpretation
as a `float32`). The 30 effective bits partition as 1 sign bit, 8 exponent bits
and 21 explicit mantissa bits (the two least significant `float32` mantissa
bits are zeroed). For example, [`0x07 0x00 0x80
0x3F`](https://play.golang.org/p/QAhFqPT9FYc) encodes the value
`1.000000476837158203125`.

It is valid for the 4 byte encoding to represent infinities and `NaN`s, but if
not loaded into `LOD0` or `LOD1`, the subsequent rendering is undefined.


### Coordinate Numbers

The encoding of a coordinate number resembles the encoding of a real number.
For 1 and 2 byte encodings, the decoded coordinate number equals `((R *
scale) - bias)`, where `R` is the decoded real number as above. The scale and
bias depends on the number of bytes in the encoding.

For a *1 byte encoding*, the scale is `1` and the bias is `64`, so that a 1
byte coordinate ranges in `[-64, +64)` at integer granularity. For example, the
coordinate `7` can be encoded as `0x8E`.

For a *2 byte encoding*, the scale is `1/64` and the bias is `128`, so that a 2
byte coordinate ranges in `[-128, +128)` at `1/64` granularity. For example,
the coordinate `7.5` can be encoded as `0x81 0x87`.

For a *4 byte encoding*, the decoded coordinate number simply equals `R`. For
example, the coordinate `7.5` can also be encoded as [`0x03 0x00 0xF0
0x40`](https://play.golang.org/p/QAhFqPT9FYc).


### Zero-to-One Numbers

A zero-to-one number is a real number that is typically in the range `[0, 1]`,
although it is valid for a value to be outside of that range. For example,
angles are expressed as a zero-to-one number: a fraction of a complete
revolution (360 degrees). Gradient stop offsets are another example.

The encoding of a zero-to-one number resembles the encoding of a real number.
For 1 and 2 byte encodings, the decoded number equals `(R * scale)`, where `R`
is the decoded real number as above. The scale depends on the number of bytes
in the encoding.

For a *1 byte encoding*, the real number (ranging up to 128) is scaled by
`1/120`. The denominator is `(2*2*2 * 3 * 5)`, so that 15 degrees (`2*π/24`
radians) can be encoded as `0x0A`.

For a *2 byte encoding*, the real number (ranging up to 16384) is scaled by
`1/15120`. The denominator is `(2*2*2*2 * 3*3*3 * 5 * 7)`. For example, 40
degrees (`2*π/9` radians) can be encoded as `0x41 0x1A`.

For a *4 byte encoding*, the decoded zero-to-one number simply equals `R`. For
example, 1 degree (`2*π/360 radians`), or `0.002777777...`, can be approximated
by the encoding [`0x63 0x0B 0x36 0x3B`](https://play.golang.org/p/QAhFqPT9FYc).


## Magic Identifier

An IconVG graphic starts with the four bytes `0x89 0x49 0x56 0x47`, which is
`"\x89IVG"`.


## Metadata

The encoded metadata starts with a natural number ([see
above](#natural-numbers)) of the number of metadata chunks in the metadata,
followed by that many chunks. Each chunk starts with the length remaining in
the chunk (again, encoded as a natural number), not including the chunk length
itself. After that is a *MID* (Metadata Identifier) natural number, then
MID-specific data. Chunks must be presented in increasing MID order and as MIDs
are natural numbers, the minimum MID is zero. MIDs cannot be repeated. All MIDs
are optional.


### MID 0 - ViewBox

Metadata Identifier 0 means that the MID-specific data contains four coordinate
values ([see above](#coordinate-numbers)). These are the `minX`, `minY`, `maxX`
and `maxY` of the graphic's *viewBox*: its bounding rectangle in (scalable)
vector space. Note that these are abstract units and not necessarily 1:1 with
pixels. If this MID is not present, the viewBox defaults to `(-32, -32, +32,
+32)`. A viewBox is invalid if `(minX > maxX)` or if `(minY > maxY)` or if at
least one of those four values are infinite or a `NaN`.


### MID 1 - Suggested Palette

Metadata Identifier 1 means that the MID-specific data contains a *suggested
palette*, e.g. to provide a default rendering of variable colors such as an
emoji's skin and hair. The suggested palette is encoded in at least one byte.
The low 6 bits of that byte form a number `N`. The high 2 bits denote the
palette color format: those high 2 bits being 0, 1, 2 or 3 mean 1, 2, 3
(direct) or 4 byte colors ([see above](#colors)). The chunk then contains `N+1`
explicit colors, in that 1, 2, 3 or 4 byte encoding. A palette has exactly `64`
colors. The `(63 - N)` implicit colors of the suggested palette are set to
opaque black. A 1 byte color that refers to the custom palette or a `CREG`
color register resolves to opaque black. If this MID is not present, the
suggested palette consists entirely of opaque black, as black is always
fashionable.


## Opcodes


### Styling Opcodes

Some op descriptions refer to an adjustment value, `ADJ`. That value is the low
three bits of the opcode, nominally in the range `[0, 8)`, although in practice
the range is `[0, 7)` as no `ADJ`-using opcode has the low three bits set.

The first 128 opcodes set the selector registers.

- Opcodes `0x00` to `0x3F` sets `CSEL` to the low 6 bits of the opcode.
- Opcodes `0x40` to `0x7F` sets `NSEL` to the low 6 bits of the opcode.

The next 64 opcodes set the color or number registers.

- Opcodes `0x80` to `0x86` sets `CREG[CSEL-ADJ]` to the 1 byte encoded color
  following the opcode.
- Opcodes `0x88` to `0x8E` sets `CREG[CSEL-ADJ]` to the 2 byte encoded color
  following the opcode.
- Opcodes `0x90` to `0x96` sets `CREG[CSEL-ADJ]` to the 3 byte direct encoded
  color following the opcode.
- Opcodes `0x98` to `0x9E` sets `CREG[CSEL-ADJ]` to the 4 byte encoded color
  following the opcode.
- Opcodes `0xA0` to `0xA6` sets `CREG[CSEL-ADJ]` to the 3 byte indirect encoded
  color following the opcode.
- Opcodes `0x87`, `0x8F`, `0x97`, `0x9F` and `0xA7` sets `CREG[CSEL]` to the 1,
  2, 3 (direct), 4 and 3 (indirect) byte encoded color, following the opcode,
  and then increments `CSEL` by `1`.
- Opcodes `0xA8` to `0xAE` sets `NREG[NSEL-ADJ]` to the real number following
  the opcode.
- Opcodes `0xB0` to `0xB6` sets `NREG[NSEL-ADJ]` to the coordinate number
  following the opcode.
- Opcodes `0xB8` to `0xBE` sets `NREG[NSEL-ADJ]` to the zero-to-one number
  following the opcode.
- Opcode `0xAF`, `0xB7` and `0xBF` sets `NREG[NSEL]` to the real, coordinate
  and zero-to-one number following the opcode, and then increments `NSEL` by
  `1`.

The remaining opcodes are miscellaneous.

- Opcodes `0xC0` to `0xC6` switch to the drawing mode, and are followed by two
  coordinates that is the path's starting location. In effect, there is an
  implicit `M` (absolute moveto) drawing op. `CREG[CSEL-ADJ]`, either a flat
  color or a gradient, will fill the path once it is complete.
- Opcode `0xC7` sets the Level of Detail bounds `LOD0` and `LOD1` to the two
  real numbers following the opcode.

All other opcodes are reserved.


### Drawing Opcodes

The drawing model is based on [SVG path
data](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData) and this description
re-uses SVG's one-letter mnemonics:

- `M` means absolute moveto,
- `m` means relative moveto,
- `L` means absolute lineto,
- `l` means relative lineto,
- `H` means absolute horizontal lineto,
- etc.

Upper and lower case mean absolute and relative coordinates. The upper case
mnemonics of the SVG operations used in IconVG's drawing mode are: `M`, `Z`,
`L`, `H`, `V`, `C`, `S`, `Q`, `T`, `A`.

IconVG differs from SVG with multiple consecutive moveto ops. SVG treats all
but the first one as lineto ops. IconVG treats them all as moveto ops.

The first 224 opcodes, those in the range `[0x00, 0xDF]`, come in contiguous
groups of 16 or 32. For example, there are 16 `Q` (absolute quadratic Bézier
curveto) opcodes, from `0x60` to `0x6F`. Those opcodes' meaning differ only in
their repeat count `RC`: how often that drawing operation is repeated. The
lowest valued opcode has a repeat count of 1, the next lowest has a repeat
count of 2 and so on. For example, the opcode `0x68` means 9 consecutive `Q`
drawing ops.

- Opcodes `0x00` to `0x1F` means `RC` consecutive `L` ops, for `RC` in `[1,
  32]`. The opcode is followed by `(2 * RC)` coordinates, `RC` sets of `(x,
  y)`.
- Opcodes `0x20` to `0x3F` are like the previous paragraph, except `L`
  (absolute) becomes `l` (relative).
- Opcodes `0x40` to `0x4F` means `RC` consecutive `T` ops, for `RC` in `[1,
  16]`. The opcode is followed by `(2 * RC)` coordinates, `RC` sets of `(x,
  y)`.
- Opcodes `0x50` to `0x5F` are like the previous paragraph, except `T`
  (absolute) becomes `t` (relative).
- Opcodes `0x60` to `0x6F` means `RC` consecutive `Q` ops, for `RC` in `[1,
  16]`. The opcode is followed by `(4 * RC)` coordinates, `RC` sets of `(x1,
  y1, x, y)`.
- Opcodes `0x70` to `0x7F` are like the previous paragraph, except `Q`
  (absolute) becomes `q` (relative).
- Opcodes `0x80` to `0x8F` means `RC` consecutive `S` ops, for `RC` in `[1,
  16]`. The opcode is followed by `(4 * RC)` coordinates, `RC` sets of `(x2,
  y2, x, y)`.
- Opcodes `0x90` to `0x9F` are like the previous paragraph, except `S`
  (absolute) becomes `s` (relative).
- Opcodes `0xA0` to `0xAF` means `RC` consecutive `C` ops, for `RC` in `[1,
  16]`. The opcode is followed by `(6 * RC)` coordinates, `RC` sets of `(x1,
  y1, x2, y2, x, y)`.
- Opcodes `0xB0` to `0xBF` are like the previous paragraph, except `C`
  (absolute) becomes `c` (relative).
- Opcodes `0xC0` to `0xCF` means `RC` consecutive `A` ops, for `RC` in `[1,
  16]`. The opcode is followed by `(6 * RC)` numbers, `RC` sets of `(rx, ry,
  xAxisRotation, flags, x, y)`. The `rx`, `ry`, `x` and `y` numbers are
  coordinates. The `xAxisRotation` number is an angle (a zero-to-one number
  being a fraction of 360 degrees). The flags are encoded as a natural number.
  The `0x01` bit of the decoded natural number is the large-arc-flag and the
  `0x02` bit is the sweep-flag.
- Opcodes `0xD0` to `0xDF` are like the previous paragraph, except `A`
  (absolute) becomes `a` (relative).

The remaining opcodes are miscellaneous.

- Opcode `0xE0` is reserved. (A future version of IconVG may use this opcode to
  mean the same as `0xE1` without the one `z` op, which will matter for stroked
  paths).
- Opcode `0xE1` means one `z` op and then end the path: fill the path with the
  color chosen when we switched to the drawing mode, and switch back to the
  styling mode. (The `Z` and `z` ops are equivalent).
- Opcode `0xE2` means one z op and then an implicit `M` op to the `(x, y)`
  coordinates after the opcode.
- Opcode `0xE3` means one z op and then an implicit `m` op to the `(x, y)`
  coordinates after the opcode.
- Opcodes `0xE4` and `0xE5` are reserved. (A future version of IconVG may use
  these for `M` and `m` ops, if we allow stroked paths).
- Opcode `0xE6` means one `H` op to the `x` coordinate after the opcode.
- Opcode `0xE7` means one `h` op to the `x` coordinate after the opcode.
- Opcode `0xE8` means one `V` op to the `y` coordinate after the opcode.
- Opcode `0xE9` means one `v` op to the `y` coordinate after the opcode.

All other opcodes are reserved.

These opcode descriptions all assume that the Level of Detail constraint ([see
above](#level-of-detail)) is satisfied. If not, the opcodes and their variable
length data are consumed, but no further action is taken (other than leaving
drawing mode).

## Appendix - Gradient Transformation Matrices

This appendix derives the affine transformation matrices `[a, b, c; d, e, f]`
for linear, circular and elliptical gradients.


### Linear Gradients

For a linear gradient from `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)`, let `dx = (x2 - x1)` and
`dy = (y2 - y1)`. In gradient coordinate space, the `y`-coordinate is ignored,
so the transformation matrix simplifies to `[a, b, c; 0, 0, 0]`. It satisfies
the three simultaneous equations:

    a*(x1   ) + b*(y1   ) + c = 0   (eq L.0)
    a*(x1+dy) + b*(y1-dx) + c = 0   (eq L.1)
    a*(x1+dx) + b*(y1+dy) + c = 1   (eq L.2)

Subtracting equation `L.0` from equations `L.1` and `L.2` yields:

    a*dy - b*dx = 0
    a*dx + b*dy = 1

So that

    a*dy*dy - b*dx*dy = 0
    a*dx*dx + b*dx*dy = dx

Overall:

    a = dx / (dx*dx + dy*dy)
    b = dy / (dx*dx + dy*dy)
    c = -a*x1 - b*y1
    d = 0
    e = 0
    f = 0


### Circular Gradients

For a circular gradient with center `(cx, cy)` and radius vector `(rx, ry)`,
such that `(cx+rx, cy+ry)` is on the circle, let

    r = math.Sqrt(rx*rx + ry*ry)

The transformation matrix maps `(cx, cy)` to `(0, 0)`, maps `(cx+r, cy)` to
`(1, 0)` and maps `(cx, cy+r)` to `(0, 1)`. Solving those six simultaneous
equations give:

    a = +1  / r
    b = +0  / r
    c = -cx / r
    d = +0  / r
    e = +1  / r
    f = -cy / r


### Elliptical Gradients

For an elliptical gradient with center `(cx, cy)` and axis vectors `(rx, ry)`
and `(sx, sy)`, such that `(cx+rx, cx+ry)` and `(cx+sx, cx+sy)` are on the
ellipse, the transformation matrix satisfies the six simultaneous equations:

    a*(cx   ) + b*(cy   ) + c = 0   (eq E.0)
    a*(cx+rx) + b*(cy+ry) + c = 1   (eq E.1)
    a*(cx+sx) + b*(cy+sy) + c = 0   (eq E.2)
    d*(cx   ) + e*(cy   ) + f = 0   (eq E.3)
    d*(cx+rx) + e*(cy+ry) + f = 0   (eq E.4)
    d*(cx+sx) + e*(cy+sy) + f = 1   (eq E.5)

Subtracting equation `E.0` from equations `E.1` and `E.2` yields:

    a*rx + b*ry = 1
    a*sx + b*sy = 0

Solving these two simultaneous equations yields:

    a = +sy / (rx*sy - sx*ry)
    b = -sx / (rx*sy - sx*ry)

Re-arranging `E.0` yields:

    c = -a*cx - b*cy

Similarly for `d`, `e` and `f` so that, overall:

    a = +sy / (rx*sy - sx*ry)
    b = -sx / (rx*sy - sx*ry)
    c = -a*cx - b*cy
    d = -ry / (rx*sy - sx*ry)
    e = +rx / (rx*sy - sx*ry)
    f = -d*cx - e*cy

Note that if `rx = r`, `ry = 0`, `sx = 0` and `sy = r` then this simplifies to
the circular gradient transformation matrix formula ([see
above](#circular-gradients)).
